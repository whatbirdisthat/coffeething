coffeething
===========

the purpose of the **coffeething** is to be very basic

where possible it is written in
* coffeescript or even better
* literate coffeescript

why **coffeething** ?
---------------------

Basically the coffeething is here just so I can prove
a few things to myself, like:

* can I define a class in a coffee file, and require it from another
* can I push objects to the constructor of a coffee class
* can I access properties of a coffee class
* can I run the methods of a coffee class

See, very basic stuff.

why **literate-coffeescript** ?
-------------------------------

This is where it gets kinda cool (I think) because
I can use the literateness of `.litcoffee` files to
embed markdown docs right there in the test files,
so adding the human-readable usage docs to the source
itself - they say good code has no comments, but
there actually exists a place for good comments:
in the tests
