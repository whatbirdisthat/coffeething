src folder
==========

This folder contains `.coffee` and `.litcoffee` files that are identical
(literate modules have `lit` prepended to the name to avoid conflicts

Originally I tried to make my implementations in literate coffeescript, but I
found that though they look nice in github etc, comments are really out of
place here inside an implementation.

Here I agree with the guideline: `good code comments itself`
